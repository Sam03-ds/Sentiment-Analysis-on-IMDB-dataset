# Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDB-dataset

In this notebook, we’ll work with the IMDB dataset containing 50,000 movie reviews, available on Kaggle. The dataset includes two columns—"review" and "sentiment"—which indicate whether a review is positive or negative.

The purpose of sentiment analysis is to determine the emotional tone or attitude expressed in a text, for example, in a review, comment, or social media post. The mood can be positive or negative. Sentiment analysis can also include determining the strength of sentiment, for example, whether it is strongly positive or weakly positive.
